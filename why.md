# Project Ideas

## What do we have? 
- NYPD stop question and frisk databases for 2003-2011
- over ** 4.2 million ** records 
- each record has 112 columns of information on the stop: justification, demographic, outcome, if force was used/why, location (street address)

- ~2.6 million records contain precise geographical coordinates
